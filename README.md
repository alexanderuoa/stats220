# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about **me**:
- I am undertaking a degree in *Data Science*
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to be adept at sourcing and leveraging data!
- I am interested in learning about JSON

The **STATS** papers I have taken so far (in order) are:
1. STATS 10x
2. STATS 125
3. STATS 20x

The [US Debt Clock Website](https://usdebtclock.org/) keeps me up at night...

... So I calm down by visiting the [Cat-Bounce Website](https://cat-bounce.com/) 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNWw4bGd6M3A3azBxeW8yaTlvOWpreDYzZWNreWt6MzFxYzg1cno1ZSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/g7GKcSzwQfugw/giphy.gif)
